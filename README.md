## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Ensure that **Docker** is installed on your system. You can download Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

### Steps

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/FAQapi.git
   cd FAQapi
   ```

2. Build the Docker containers:
   ```bash

## API Usage

The API provides an endpoint to fetch FAQs in different languages. Below are some examples of how to use the API:

### Fetch FAQs in English
```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/api/faqs/?lang=en
```

### Fetch FAQs in the default language (English)
```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/api/faqs/
```

### Fetch FAQs with an invalid language code
```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/api/faqs/?lang=rubbish
```

### Response Format
The API returns a JSON object with the following structure:
```json
{
  "lang": "en",
  "question1": "What is the capital of France?",
  "answer1": "Paris is the capital of France."
}
```

## Measuring Performance

### Caching Mechanism
The API uses Redis for caching. To check if caching is being used:
- **Console Messages**: Look for `"cache in use"` or `"cache not in use"` in the server logs.
- **Browser DevTools**: Open the browser's developer tools (`Inspect Element` -> `Network` tab) and check the response times for the API requests.

## Unit Tests

To run unit tests, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed, then run:
```bash
npm test
```

This will execute the test suite using Jest and provide a coverage report.
